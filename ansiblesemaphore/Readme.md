Please make sure to replace the placeholder passwords with your own strong passwords. Additionally, you can enable host key checking by setting ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=true in the environment section of the semaphore service.

Remember to replace the my-strong-password and my-strong-admin-password placeholders with your own strong passwords.

Also, make sure to replace the authorized-keys and config directories with your own directories containing the necessary files for Ansible Semaphore.

Finally, run docker-compose up -d to start the services.
